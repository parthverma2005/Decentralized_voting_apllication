1. Decentralized Voting Application
A decentralized voting system built on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of votes.  
This project was built as a learning experience to understand blockchain concepts, explore how smart contracts work in Solidity, and see how decentralized applications (DApps) can be integrated into real-world use cases like digital voting.

2. Features
- Secure and transparent voting process stored on the blockchain  
- Voter authentication through MetaMask  
- Prevents double voting  
- Real-time vote counting with blockchain immutability  
- Smart contracts written in Solidity for handling election logic  
- Easy-to-use React.js frontend connected to blockchain via Web3.js  

3. Tech Stack
- Blockchain & Smart Contracts: Solidity, Truffle, Ganache  
- Frontend: React.js, Web3.js  
- Backend/Environment: Node.js  
- Wallet Integration: MetaMask
